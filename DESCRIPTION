Title: Chunk Indifferent Ranking Algorithm for Scoring Ranked Lists with Groups
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Vanessa Sochat <vsochat@stanford.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: Calculates an accuracy for a ranked list of binary, monotonic groupings, "chunks" for which an ordering of the groups is desired, but no order of the elelmens within the groups is specified.  For example, if doing a query to return a list of results, we may want the first N to be of a particular type, but we don't care about the ordering within those first N. We may next want a group of type G, followed by R, and for both we are indifferent about the rankings within the groups.
